00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,640
The Bear's whisper

2
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,780
Two travelers John and Bob are walking through a forest

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,100
They are best friends

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,500
"It's getting dark"

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
"How much longer must we go, Bob?"

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,860
"We are almost there"

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,060
"I'm scared, let's hurry"

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,280
"Don't be scared John, I'm here"

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,660
"But, what if we meet a Lion? Or maybe a bear"

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,780
"Don't worry, I'll protect you"

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,020
"Really?"

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,980
"Of course, we are best friends. right?"

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,100
"I'll always protect you"

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,120
"Thanks Bob, you are a true friend"

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,920
"Come on let's go, we have to go over that hill"

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,760
"Bob, let's rest here for a while. I'm tired"

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,780
John and Bob decide to rest for a few minutes before going over the hill

18
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,740
"We can rest here for a while"

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,340
"But we can't stay too long the sun will go down soon"

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,060
"My feet hurt, I'm going to take off my shoes"

21
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,100
John takes off his shoes

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,000
Suddenly he hears a strange sound

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,540
"Did you hear that Bob?"

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,560
"What?"

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,260
"I heard a strange sound"

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,040
"What strange sound? I didn't hear anything"

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,500
"I really heard something"

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,620
"What did it sound like?"

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,040
"I'm not sure, but it sounded like a bear"

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,340
"A bear? that can't be"

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,020
"There aren't any bears around here"

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,220
"I hope you are right"

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,720
The two listen carefully for a while

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,160
They don't hear anything

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
"I told you it's nothing, don't worry"

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,680
"Besides If it's a bear, I'll protect you"

37
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,580
"Thanks Bob, you are really brave"

38
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,540
"I'm glad you are my friend"

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,180
"I'm your best friend you can always trust me"

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,440
"Let's go now John, put on your shoes"

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,640
"OK"

42
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,560
John is putting on his shoes

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,160
A Bear sees the two

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,800
"I'm hungry, I need some food"

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,920
"Hey! look over there, my worries are over"

46
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,860
"There is my lunch, and dinner"

47
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,660
The Bear comes out of the bush

48
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,140
"Hello you two, don't run away"

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,220
"I'm gonna eat you up"

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,800
"Oh my goodness! it's a bear! a real bear!"

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,800
Bob runs away quickly by himself

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,820
He doesn't think of John

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,420
John still doesn't have his shoes on

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,200
So he can't run very fast

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,020
"Run for your life!"

56
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,480
"Wait for me Bob, I can't run that fast"

57
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,600
"Help me! please!"

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,300
Bob doesn't help John

59
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,320
He climbs up a tree by himself

60
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,980
"I can't climb up a tree what shall I do?"

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,380
"Maybe I'll pretend to be dead"

62
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,860
"Bears don't eat dead meat"

63
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,180
John pretends to be dead

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,520
He just lies down on the ground

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,660
"I got you"

66
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,060
"Get up, I know you are not dead"

67
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,000
"Come on, get up"

68
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,240
"Maybe he really is dead"

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,500
"He's not moving or breathing"

70
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,620
"But he is warm, I don't understand"

71
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,940
The bear keeps sniffing John

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,360
It looks as if the bear was whispering something to John

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,040
"Perhaps he's dead, I better just go for now"

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,840
The bear leaves John alone and goes

75
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,300
Bob comes down from the tree

76
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,360
"John, Are you OK?"

77
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,560
"I think so, but why didn't you help me?"

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,820
"I was going to help"

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,960
"But the bear just went away, please forgive me"

80
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,300
"But what did the bear whisper to you?"

81
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,920
"Do you really want to know?"

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,540
"Yes, I'm really curious"

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,600
"Well, he told me to stay away from you"

84
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,260
"A friend that runs away by himself, is not a true friend"

85
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,420
"I agree with him"

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,980
"You are not my true friend, goodbye"

87
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,360
Moral

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,320
A friend in need is a friend indeed

89
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:56,480
The end
